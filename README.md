WALS Scripts
============

This is a set of scripts to play with WALS. I'm interested in finding language similarity and language clusters using WALS features.

I'm particularly interested in using phonological features for the purpose of transliteration. These are features 1-19. 

See a demo of langsim.py at http://104.131.29.154:1234/langsim
